# Bank-Loan-Report

Just wrapped up this Bank Loan Report Dashboard in Power BI and thought I’d share a few insights 📊

I started by building a Star Schema data model to keep everything clean and scalable—fact and dimension tables made the analysis smoother and more insightful.

Analyzed over 38K loan applications, with $435M funded and $473M received.

🔹 86% Good Loans (fully funded & repaid)
🔸 14% Bad Loans — worth deeper risk analysis
💰 Avg Interest Rate: 12% | Avg DTI: 13%

📈 Month-over-month growth:

+6.9% applications

+13% funding

+16% received amount

📍 Top applying states: CA, NY, FL, TX
🔁 Top loan purpose: Debt Consolidation (~50%)
👨‍💼 Most applicants had either <1 year or 10+ years of work experience

Really enjoyed working on this—it brought together finance, analytics, and storytelling in one place.

Open to feedback or ideas—always learning!
